2. Given an array in which there are arrays that are of length two, the first index of that array has the student name and the second index has the marks scored. Find the maximum average scored by any student. The array can have multiple subjects of marks for a particular student.

```java

üß† Thought Process
We need to:
1. Track total scores and count of scores for each student.
2. Compute average per student.
3. Keep track of the maximum average seen.

Use a Map<String, int[]>:
- Key: Student name
- Value: int[2] ‚Üí [0]: total score, [1]: count

At the end, iterate through the map and calculate average per student, storing the max.

‚úÖ Constraints
1. Scores are integers.
2. You can assume valid input (no missing or malformed entries).
3. Student names are case-sensitive.


import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    /**
     * Returns the maximum average score among all students.
     *
     * @param records A list of student name and score pairs.
     * @return Maximum average score as double.
     */
    public static double getMaxAverageScore(List<List<String>> records) {
        if (records == null || records.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input records cannot be null or empty");
        }

        // Map to store: student -> [totalScore, count]
        Map<String, int[]> studentScores = new HashMap<>();

        for (List<String> record : records) {
            if (record.size() != 2) continue;

            String name = record.get(0);
            int score = Integer.parseInt(record.get(1));

            studentScores.computeIfAbsent(name, k -> new int[2]);
            studentScores.get(name)[0] += score; // total
            studentScores.get(name)[1] += 1;     // count
        }

        double maxAverage = Double.MIN_VALUE;

        for (Map.Entry<String, int[]> entry : studentScores.entrySet()) {
            int total = entry.getValue()[0];
            int count = entry.getValue()[1];
            double avg = (double) total / count;
            maxAverage = Math.max(maxAverage, avg);
        }

        return maxAverage;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<List<String>> input = Arrays.asList(
            Arrays.asList("Alice", "90"),
            Arrays.asList("Bob", "80"),
            Arrays.asList("Alice", "100"),
            Arrays.asList("Bob", "70"),
            Arrays.asList("Charlie", "95")
        );

        double result = getMaxAverageScore(input);
        System.out.println("Maximum average score: " + result); // Output: 95.0
    }
}

```

        if (denominator < 0) {
            numerator *= -1;
            denominator *= -1;
        }

        System.out.println(numerator + "/" + denominator);
    }

    /**
     * Adds two fractions (numerator1/denominator1 + numerator2/denominator2),
     * and prints the result in its simplest form.
     */
    static void addFractions(int numerator1, int denominator1, int numerator2, int denominator2) {
        if (denominator1 == 0 || denominator2 == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Denominator cannot be zero");
        }

        int gcdDenominators = gcd(denominator1, denominator2);
        int lcmDenominator = (denominator1 / gcdDenominators) * denominator2;

        int adjustedNumerator1 = numerator1 * (lcmDenominator / denominator1);
        int adjustedNumerator2 = numerator2 * (lcmDenominator / denominator2);

        int resultNumerator = adjustedNumerator1 + adjustedNumerator2;

        lowerFraction(resultNumerator, lcmDenominator);

25. a) You are an avid rock collector who lives in southern California. Some rare and desirable rocks just became available in New York, so you are planning a cross-country road trip. There are several other rare rocks that you could pick up along the way. You have been given a grid filled with numbers, representing the number of rare rocks available in various cities across the country. Your objective is to find the optimal path from So_Cal to New_York that would allow you to accumulate the most rocks along the way.

Note: You can only travel either north (up) or east (right).
b) Consider adding some additional tests in doTestsPass().
c) Implement optimalPath() correctly.
d) Here is an example:
^
{{0, 0, 0, 0, 5}, New_York (finish) N
{0, 1, 1, 1, 0},
So_Cal (start) {2, 0, 0, 0, 0}} S
v
The total for this example would be 10 (2+0+1+1+1+0+5).

25. Given a string. Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in it. If there is no non-repeating character, return 0;
e.g.

aabbccd d
abbccddee a
iijjkkllmm 0

26. Implement a function that takes two unsigned integers as arguments namely numerator & denominator and outputs a string representing the fraction in decimal form. If there is a repeating and non-terminating digit that appears in the decimal form, write that in parenthesis.
e.g.
Input (UINT n, UINT d) Output (string)
‚Äî‚Äì ‚Äî‚Äî
2, 5 0.4
1, 2 0.5
1, 3 0.(3)

29. Top K Frequent Elements

    ```java
    /**
     * Returns the k most frequent elements from the given array of integers.
     *
     * Detailed Explanation of the Steps:
     *   1) Create a frequency map freqMap:
     *      - Key: Integer (the element)
     *      - Value: Integer (the frequency of that element)
     *      This lets us track how many times each integer appears in O(n) time.
     *
     *   2) Build an array of lists (buckets), where index i in 'buckets' corresponds 
     *      to a list of elements that appear i times.
     *      - The size of this array is nums.length + 1, because the highest possible
     *        frequency of any element is n (if all elements are identical).
     *
     *   3) For each unique number in freqMap, append it to the corresponding bucket 
     *      based on its frequency.
     *
     *   4) Traverse the buckets from the highest frequency index down to the lowest,
     *      and collect elements until we've collected k of them. 
     *
     * Time Complexity:
     *   - Step 1 (frequency map creation): O(n).
     *   - Step 2 (bucket array creation) : O(n).
     *   - Step 3 (filling buckets)       : O(n) in worst case (each element is unique).
     *   - Step 4 (collecting top k)      : O(n) in worst case.
     *   => Overall O(n).
     *
     * Space Complexity:
     *   - freqMap can have up to n entries in the worst case => O(n).
     *   - buckets array is size n+1, with each index a list => O(n).
     *   => Overall O(n).

     * @param k number of most frequent elements to retrieve
     * @return an array of the k most frequent integers in any order

/**
 * LeetCode Problem #166: Fraction to Recurring Decimal
 *
 * We want to convert a fraction (numerator/denominator) into its decimal string representation.
 * If the fractional part repeats, we must enclose the repeating sequence in parentheses.
 *
 * Below is a production-ready, thoroughly commented solution that:
 *  1) Handles signs correctly (including 0).
 *  2) Uses a Map<Long, Integer> to track the position of each remainder in the result,
 *     so we know where the repeating portion begins.
 *  3) Efficiently builds the output using StringBuilder.
 *  4) Avoids integer overflow by working with long values for divisions.
 *
 * Short and Simple Thought Process in Comments:
 *  1) Capture sign.
 *  2) Handle integer division part.
 *  3) Move to remainder and store each remainder in a map alongside the current length of the result.
 *     If we see the remainder again, that means the digits between the first occurrence and now are repeating.
 *  4) Insert parentheses accordingly and return.
 *
 * Choice of Data Structures:
 *  - StringBuilder for efficient string concatenations.
 *  - HashMap<Long, Integer> to map each remainder to the position in the resulting decimal string,
 *    enabling O(1) lookups to detect the start of the repeating cycle.
 *
 * Performance Complexity:
 *  - The main loop processes each new remainder at most once until it repeats or becomes zero,
 *    making the time complexity O(k), where k is the number of digits before repetition or termination.
 *  - Space complexity is also O(k) due to storing each unique remainder at most once in the map.
 *
 * This solution is designed for clarity, correctness, and speed.
 * It should run in constant space relative to the size of the integer range constraints,
 * but variable space/time in proportion to the output decimal length.

32. Problem: 
"""
A popular online retailer allows vendors to specify different prices in advance
for the same item throughout the day. We now need to design an algorithm that
helps identify the lowest price for the item at any point of the day.

Assumptions:

For the algorithm, assume all vendors are selling the same product
and there is only one product being sold. Given a list that has
vendor information - ( startTime, endTime, price ) of the deal,
return a sorted list with different possible intervals and
the least price of the product during the interval.

The interval is inclusive of start and end time.

All the 3 values passed by the vendor are integers.

sampleInput = { new Interval( 1, 5, 20 ), new Interval( 3, 8, 15 ), new Interval( 7, 10, 8 ) };
expectedOutput = { new Interval( 1, 2, 20 ), new Interval( 3, 6, 15 ), new Interval( 7, 10, 8 ) };

"""

Solution:

```java

/*
 * ****************************************************************************
 *  A Popular Online Retailer:
 *  -------------------------
 *  Vendors can each specify a startTime, endTime, and price for a product deal,
 *  covering an inclusive time interval [startTime..endTime].
 *  Multiple vendors can overlap in time, each with their own price.
 *  
 *  We want to combine these possibly-overlapping intervals to produce a list
 *  of sorted, non-overlapping intervals in which each interval reflects the
 *  cheapest (lowest) price available during that particular timespan.
 *  
 *  Example:
 *    Input intervals: 
 *      (1, 5, 20),  (3, 8, 15),  (7, 10, 8)
 *    Sorted by startTime, they overlap in the ranges [3..5] and [7..8].
 *    We must figure out the minimum price in each overlapping segment.
 *    The final intervals become:
 *      [1..2]  -> only one interval (1..5, 20) active => price = 20
 *      [3..6]  -> intervals (1..5, 20) & (3..8, 15) overlap => min price = 15
 *      [7..10] -> intervals (3..8, 15) & (7..10, 8) overlap => min price = 8
 *  
 *  --> Expected Output: (1, 2, 20), (3, 6, 15), (7, 10, 8)
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Implementation Approach:
 *  ------------------------
 *  1) We represent each vendor interval [startTime, endTime, price] in a 
 *     small internal structure "Interval".
 *
 *  2) We convert each input interval into two "events":
 *       - (time = startTime,  price, delta = +1) to indicate the price 
 *         is becoming active at time = startTime.
 *       - (time = endTime+1,  price, delta = -1) to indicate the price 
 *         stops being active immediately after endTime (because it's inclusive).
 *     This technique is commonly known as a "Line Sweep" or "Sweep Line" approach.
 *
 *  3) Sort all these events by:
 *       (a) ascending time
 *       (b) if tie on time, then process +1 (start) before -1 (end)
 *
 *  4) Maintain a min-heap (PriorityQueue<Integer>) holding all currently active prices, 
 *     coupled with a HashMap<Integer, Integer> to track how many times a given price 
 *     is active. (Because multiple intervals can share the same price.)
 *
 *     - When we see an event with delta = +1, we add/increment that price in the map,
 *       and if it‚Äôs newly encountered, we push it into the min-heap.
 *     - When we see an event with delta = -1, we decrement that price‚Äôs active count 
 *       in the map. If the count goes to zero, we‚Äôll lazily remove it from the min-heap 
 *       at some point (i.e., we keep popping from the heap until the top‚Äôs count 
 *       is nonzero).
 *
 *  5) The top of the min-heap at any time gives us the currently cheapest price 
 *     among those intervals that are active. As we move from one event‚Äôs time to the next, 
 *     if the cheapest price changes, we conclude the previous interval ended, 
 *     and we begin a new interval with the updated minimum price.
 *
 *  6) We store these finalized intervals in a result list, carefully handling boundaries:
 *     - The "start" time for a cheapest-price interval is the first moment 
 *       that price became the cheapest.
 *     - The "end" time is the moment right before the price changes or no interval 
 *       remains active.
 *
 *  7) Output:
 *     The final result is a sorted list of intervals with distinct time segments 
 *     and the lowest price in each segment.
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Complexity:
 *  -----------
 *  - Let N = number of input intervals.
 *  - We produce up to 2N events, then sort them in O(N log N) time.
 *  - We iterate over these events once (O(N)), each event insertion/removal 
 *    from a min-heap is O(log N) worst-case, so total O(N log N).
 *  - The space complexity is O(N) for storing events, the heap, and the map.
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Implementation Details for a Single CoderPad-Class "Solution":
 *  --------------------------------------------------------------
 *  - We'll define a nested static class Interval within this single "Solution" class.
 *  - We'll implement a main(...) method at the bottom that demonstrates usage 
 *    by creating sample input and printing the result.
 *  - We'll provide a helper method "getLowestPriceIntervals(Interval[] input)" 
 *    which performs the line-sweep approach and returns a List<Interval>.
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Short & Simple Thought Process:
 *    - Convert intervals to "start" & "end+1" events
 *    - Sort events
 *    - Sweep across times:
 *       + Add new intervals' prices in min-heap
 *       + Remove intervals' prices that ended 
 *       + Track changes of the top of the heap to finalize intervals
 *
 * ****************************************************************************
 *
 *  Explanation of Data Structures:
 *  -------------------------------
 *  1) PriorityQueue<Integer> (Min-Heap): 
 *     - We store all active prices so that we can efficiently query 
 *       the smallest price in O(1) time (top of the heap).
 *     - Each insertion/removal is O(log N).
 *
 *  2) HashMap<Integer, Integer> activeCount:
 *     - Maps a price -> the count of how many intervals are currently contributing 
 *       that price (due to overlapping intervals).
 *     - This is crucial for "lazy" deletion. We only pop from the heap while 
 *       the top price has a count of zero in the map (meaning it‚Äôs no longer active).

33. find the second smallest number in an array

```java
/**
 * Efficient implementation to find the second smallest number in an array.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * - Time complexity is O(n): We traverse the array once.
 * - Space complexity is O(1): No extra data structures used, only two tracking variables.
 * - We handle edge cases like:
 *     * Arrays with fewer than 2 distinct elements (throws exception)
 *     * Arrays with duplicates
 *     * Negative values and integer boundaries
 * - The algorithm tracks both the smallest and the second smallest elements in one pass.
 * - Proper use of Integer.MAX_VALUE ensures correctness even with negative numbers.
