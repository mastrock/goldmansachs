1. Suppose we are given a string ‚Äúaaabbbbbccccdaa‚Äù, then we to print ‚Äúa3b5c4d1a2‚Äù. 
    Run length encoding: https://github.com/jhasuraj01/6companies30days/blob/main/goldman-sachs/run-length-encoding.md

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * Compresses the given string using run-length encoding
     * and returns the resulting compressed string.
     *
     * Example:
     *   Input:  "aaabbbbbccccdaa"

     *
     * @param s the input string to compress
     * @return a new string containing the compressed representation
     */
    public String compressString(String s) {
        // Handle edge cases: null or empty input.
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return "";
        }

        // StringBuilder is ideal for efficient appends.
        StringBuilder compressed = new StringBuilder();

        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        int charCount = 1;  // We'll start counting from the first character.

        // Traverse from the second character to the end.
        // Compare chars[i] with chars[i-1] to detect runs.
        for (int i = 1; i < chars.length; i++) {
            if (chars[i] == chars[i - 1]) {

2. Given an array in which there are arrays that are of length two, the first index of that array has the student name and the second index has the marks scored. Find the maximum average scored by any student. The array can have multiple subjects of marks for a particular student.

```java

üß† Thought Process
We need to:
1. Track total scores and count of scores for each student.
2. Compute average per student.
3. Keep track of the maximum average seen.

Use a Map<String, int[]>:
- Key: Student name
- Value: int[2] ‚Üí [0]: total score, [1]: count

At the end, iterate through the map and calculate average per student, storing the max.

‚úÖ Constraints
1. Scores are integers.
2. You can assume valid input (no missing or malformed entries).
3. Student names are case-sensitive.


import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    /**
     * Returns the maximum average score among all students.
     *
     * @param records A list of student name and score pairs.
     * @return Maximum average score as double.
     */
    public static double getMaxAverageScore(List<List<String>> records) {
        if (records == null || records.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input records cannot be null or empty");
        }

        // Map to store: student -> [totalScore, count]
        Map<String, int[]> studentScores = new HashMap<>();

        for (List<String> record : records) {
            if (record.size() != 2) continue;

            String name = record.get(0);
            int score = Integer.parseInt(record.get(1));

            studentScores.computeIfAbsent(name, k -> new int[2]);
            studentScores.get(name)[0] += score; // total
            studentScores.get(name)[1] += 1;     // count
        }

        double maxAverage = Double.MIN_VALUE;

        for (Map.Entry<String, int[]> entry : studentScores.entrySet()) {
            int total = entry.getValue()[0];
            int count = entry.getValue()[1];
            double avg = (double) total / count;
            maxAverage = Math.max(maxAverage, avg);
        }

        return maxAverage;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<List<String>> input = Arrays.asList(
            Arrays.asList("Alice", "90"),
            Arrays.asList("Bob", "80"),
            Arrays.asList("Alice", "100"),
            Arrays.asList("Bob", "70"),
            Arrays.asList("Charlie", "95")
        );

        double result = getMaxAverageScore(input);
        System.out.println("Maximum average score: " + result); // Output: 95.0
    }
}

14. There are some students, sitting in a circle. Each student is assigned a roll no (1 to n). There is a teacher who was given an initial roll no and he has to remove the student with initial roll no. and then has to remove the student who was at that position starting from the removed student.

25. a) You are an avid rock collector who lives in southern California. Some rare and desirable rocks just became available in New York, so you are planning a cross-country road trip. There are several other rare rocks that you could pick up along the way. You have been given a grid filled with numbers, representing the number of rare rocks available in various cities across the country. Your objective is to find the optimal path from So_Cal to New_York that would allow you to accumulate the most rocks along the way.

Note: You can only travel either north (up) or east (right).
b) Consider adding some additional tests in doTestsPass().
c) Implement optimalPath() correctly.
d) Here is an example:
^
{{0, 0, 0, 0, 5}, New_York (finish) N
{0, 1, 1, 1, 0},
So_Cal (start) {2, 0, 0, 0, 0}} S
v
The total for this example would be 10 (2+0+1+1+1+0+5).

25. Given a string. Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in it. If there is no non-repeating character, return 0;
e.g.
Input (string) Output (char)
‚Äî‚Äì ‚Äî‚Äî
aabbccd d
abbccddee a
iijjkkllmm 0

26. Implement a function that takes two unsigned integers as arguments namely numerator & denominator and outputs a string representing the fraction in decimal form. If there is a repeating and non-terminating digit that appears in the decimal form, write that in parenthesis.
e.g.
Input (UINT n, UINT d) Output (string)
‚Äî‚Äì ‚Äî‚Äî
2, 5 0.4
1, 2 0.5
1, 3 0.(3)
12, 5 2.4
11, 20 0.55
5, 3 1.(6)

28. Largest tree in a forest

```java

/* Problem Name is &&& Largest Tree &&& PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE. */
/*
 **  Instructions:
 **
 **  Given a forest ( one or more disconnected trees ), find the root of largest tree
 **  and return its Id. If there are multiple such roots, return the smallest Id of them.
 **
 **  Complete the largestTree function in the editor below.
 **  It has one parameter, immediateParent, which is a map containing key-value pair indicating
 **  child -> parent relationship. The key is child and value is the corresponding
 **  immediate parent.
 **  Constraints
 **    - Child cannot have more than one immediate parent.
 **    - Parent can have more than one immediate child.
 **    - The given key-value pair forms a well-formed forest ( a tree of n nodes will have n-1 edges )
 **
 **  Example:
 **
 **  Input:
 **  { { 1 -> 2 }, { 3 -> 4 } }
 **
 **  Expected output: 2
 **  Explanation: There are two trees one having root of Id 2 and another having root of Id 4.
 **  Both trees have size 2. The smaller number of 2 and 4 is 2. Hence the answer is 2.
